# Animated Navigation

This is the Animated Navigation project (Day 14) in the [Udemy course 50 projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?src=sac&kw=50+projects+50+days).

## Project Details

The goal of the project is to create a navigation bar that opens and closes with special animation effects.

## Features

- Navigation bar presents the option to close the bar with an icon in its initial state.
- When clicked, the icon and navigation links transform to display rotating effects as the links disappear and the icon turns into a two line burger.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## My Process

- Start the files from a boiler template.
- Create the navigation bar with four links and a button that is made of two lines.
- Add styles for the application.
- Grab the target elements in the JS file.
- Apply an event listener to the button that will toggle the active class, initiating a variety of transitions:
    * One for the icon rotation.
    * One for the rotation and opacity of links.
    * One for the container width.

### Continued development

With this project, I was able to enhance my CSS skills by further solidifying knowledge of the transition and transform properties. I enjoy utilizing great animation effects and will likely implement an adaptation of this project in the future.
